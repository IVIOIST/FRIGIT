                ="1.Prepare the Turkey Mixture: In a large mixing bowl, combine the ground turkey, breadcrumbs, finely chopped onion, minced garlic, Worcestershire sauce, dried oregano, dried thyme, paprika, salt, and pepper. Use your hands or a spoon to mix everything together until well combined. Be careful not to overmix, as this can result in tough burgers.
                2.Form Patties: Divide the turkey mixture into 4 equal portions. Shape each portion into a patty, about 1/2 to 3/4 inch thick. Make an indentation in the center of each patty with your thumb to prevent them from bulging while cooking.
                3.Preheat Grill or Skillet: Preheat your grill or a skillet over medium-high heat. If using a skillet, lightly oil the surface to prevent sticking.
                4.Cook Burgers: Once the grill or skillet is hot, place the turkey patties on the cooking surface. Cook for about 5-6 minutes on each side, or until the burgers are cooked through and reach an internal temperature of 165°F (75°C). Avoid pressing down on the burgers while cooking, as this can cause them to dry out.
                5.Toast Buns: While the burgers are cooking, you can optionally toast the burger buns on the grill or in a toaster until lightly golden.
                6.Assemble Burgers: Once the turkey burgers are cooked, remove them from the grill or skillet. Place each burger on a bun and add your desired toppings, such as lettuce, tomato, onion slices, cheese, condiments, etc.
                7.Serve: Serve the turkey burgers immediately while they're still warm and enjoy!"
