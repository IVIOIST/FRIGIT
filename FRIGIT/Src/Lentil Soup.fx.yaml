                1.Prepare the Lentils: Rinse the lentils under cold water in a fine-mesh sieve and remove any debris or stones.2.Sauté Aromatics: Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Add diced onion, carrots, and celery. Sauté until the vegetables are softened, about 5-7 minutes. Add minced garlic and sauté for another minute until fragrant.
                3.Add Spices: Stir in the ground cumin, ground coriander, paprika, salt, and pepper. Cook for an additional minute to toast the spices and release their flavors.
                4.Combine Ingredients: Add the rinsed lentils, diced tomatoes (with their juices), and broth to the pot. Stir to combine all the ingredients.
                5.Simmer: Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce the heat to low. Cover the pot and let the soup simmer gently for about 25-30 minutes, or until the lentils are tender.
                6.Adjust Seasoning: Taste the soup and adjust the seasoning with salt and pepper if needed.Serve: Ladle the soup into bowls. Garnish with fresh chopped parsley or cilantro if desired. Serve hot with lemon wedges on the side for squeezing over the soup."
